								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Balancia, El Dorado Hills&#8217; most breathtaking estate. It&#8217;s beautiful, tranquil, private and secure. It has every amenity you can think of and then some. You are going to fall in love with Balancia!! A remarkable, unhurried 15,000 feet under roof. Two acres of gorgeously landscaped grounds. The central courtyard is completely private and the entire property walled and fenced. With its single-story living, there is a degree of hominess and comfort that is rare for a home of this scale. Balancia has an easy internal and external flow that comes to life with consideration for family, pets, long and short-term guests, and festivities large and small. Every aspect of the home was executed with purpose and precision. It is that rarest of homes, built to age, adding a patina that will improve year after year. You can feel how this home will be filled with great stories, celebrations, noteworthy guests, and family memories that will last for generations. Available turnkey furnished.</p>
